Features:
* Easiest Admin Menu to use within the vRP framework
* Everything you need for an admin menu
* Uses vRP groups to justify use of the menu
* Easily configurable to your liking (can enable or disable any button.)
* Admins can't ban admins. (this is configurable)

Notes:
* This is only limited to the vRP framework, feel free to edit it to your liking but the default one that comes within the [GitHub](https://github.com/arthur-rl/vrp_admin) is vRP.
* To use this menu you must have the permission set in cfg/config.lua which by default is "admin.menu".
